**Day 1:Introduction to IC package, chip, pads, core and IPs**

### Integrated Circuits (ICs) are the backbone of contemporary electronic devices, ranging from smartphones to sophisticated computing systems. Grasping the architecture and functionality of ICs is essential for understanding the operation of electronic devices at their core. ICs are composed of several critical elements, including packaging, semiconductor chips, connection pads, the central processing core, and Intellectual Properties (IPs), among others.

Arduino Microcontroller Board: The section in focus depicts the microprocessor (chip) integrated with other components on the board. The chipâ€™s design journey, from conceptualization to physical production, follows the Register-Transfer Level (RTL) to the Graphic Data System II (GDSII) flow. The Arduino platform includes a programmable hardware entity, known as a microcontroller, and a software aspect, the Integrated Development Environment (IDE). This IDE is executed on a computer to develop and upload programs to the microcontroller hardware. ###
